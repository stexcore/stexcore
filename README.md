- 👋 Hi, I'm @stexcore
- 👀 I'm interested in developing web applications. Although it sounds a bit contradictory, my goal when developing
is to try not to have an excessive number of dependencies.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning I'm studying Computer Science at an academic level.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on as many projects as possible, as I want to expand my knowledge as much as possible.
