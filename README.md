- 👋 Hi, I’m @stexcore
- 👀 I’m interested in web application development. Although it may sound a bit contradictory, my goal when developing
  is to try to have an excessive number of dependencies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning I am studying Computer Science at an academic level.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on all possible projects, since I want to expand my knowledge to the maximum.
